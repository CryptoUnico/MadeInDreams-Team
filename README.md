## What is the MadeInDreams Project?

The project could be consider as a NFT wallet for some, or a trading bot for others, some might use it as a bank and even a DEX.
The MadeInDreams Node Project is:

### The Node
An Electron App for easy distribution to the public. The Electron app provides a GUI for the node process in the background.

The node process is the Core of the Project. It handles all the developer's modules, the Wallet, API calls.

The wallet is not exposed to the GUI. It resides in the node. We use a standard .keystore encrypted file to store the wallet.

The modules are add-ons made by developers that add new functionality to the node. Like flash loans, Arbitrage starties, and so on. The only limit is your imagination.

The Project Will be Open Source on launch.

The node process offers:

- A standard Ethereun Wallet
- A NFT Wallet & Viewer
- A Arbitrage Trading bot with Flash Loans
- A Liquidation bot with Flash Loans
- A P2P DEX

The node is using a mongo DB to keep data from Trades on the MadeInDreams Protocol, Crypto Prices, Gas Prices and NFT Data. 

The API's used at this point ;

- DEFI-PULSE 
- CoinGecko
- CoinMarketCap
- Compound



The Node also uses smart contract to extend the wallet functionality on the network making it a Unique experience for the average user.

Things you can do with the app:

-Create your own ERC20 and NFT from your Node.
-Swap or Exchange from your Node.
-Invest from your Node.
-Earn Interest.
-Make some Passive Income.

The next great addition might be your own. Join the team.
